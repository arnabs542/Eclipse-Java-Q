 * Question - Spiral Order Traverse I (medium):
 *   Traverse an N N 2D array in spiral order clock-wise starting from the top left corner. 
 *   Return the list of traversal sequence.
 *   
 *   Example: 
 *    { {1,  2,  3},
 *      {4,  5,  6},
 *      {7,  8,  9} }
 *    the traversal sequence is [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
